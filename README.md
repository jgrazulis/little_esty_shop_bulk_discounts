# Little Esty Shop: Bulk Discounts #

## Overview ##
This project is an extension of the Little Esty Shop group project. This project adds functionality for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items. 
  - A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”.
